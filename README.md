# CNS Fatigue Manager

A data-driven web application designed to track Central Nervous System (CNS) fatigue and optimize athletic performance by preventing overtraining.

## 1. Project Overview

- **The Problem**: In high-intensity training (e.g., Jiu-Jitsu, Weightlifting), CNS fatigue often occurs before or lasts longer than muscle soreness, yet it is difficult to measure objectively.
- **The Solution**: This service aggregates sleep data, performance metrics, and subjective fatigue levels to visualize the user's recovery state, helping athletes decide when to push and when to deload.

## 2. Key Features

- **Fatigue Tracking**: Log daily condition, sleep quality, and training intensity.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts showing CNS recovery curves vs. training load (CNS Fatigue vs. Recovery).
- **Training Recommendations**: Suggests optimal training intensity based on current recovery status.

## 3. Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Linting**: ESLint, Prettier
- **State Management**: (TBD: e.g., TanStack Query, Zustand)
- **Database/Auth**: (TBD: e.g., Supabase, Firebase)
